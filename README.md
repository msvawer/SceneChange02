Changing Scenes in VR with a persistent scene that holds the XR Rig

Import scenes you wish to use

Create an empty game object where XR Rig currently is in each scene.  The transform's should be the same. Name this gameobject XRRigOrigin and tag it with that name as well.

Delete the XR Rig if there is one. We will script the persistent XR Rig to pop up in the transform of the empty gameobject we just tagged as XRRigOrigin
